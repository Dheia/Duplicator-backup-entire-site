# Install
Download the module and [install it](https://modules.processwire.com/install-uninstall/)

### SDK Installation (optional)
You can skip these instructions if you plan to only use the built-in features `Local Folder` or `FTP/FTPS`.

If you want to use `GoogleDrive`, `Dropbox` or `AmazonS3`, you have two choices of type of installation. Using Composer or downloading directly a ZIP archive from the repository.

Installing all SDK are not required, you can choose the one you need.

#### Using Composer
In the root directory of your ProcessWire installation, just type in a terminal :
* `composer require google/apiclient`
* `composer require dropbox/dropbox-sdk`
* `composer require aws/aws-sdk-php`

#### ZIP Archive
After downloading an archive, open it, you will find a folder called **`SDKs`**. Extract or Upload this folder in the **`Duplicator module folder`**. If the folder already exist, merge it. Example: `/www/mysite/wwwroot/site/modules/Duplicator/SDKs`

Download Links:
* [GoogleDrive SDK (not uploaded yet)]()
* [Dropbox SDK (not uploaded yet)]()
* [AmazonS3 SDK (not uploaded yet)]()


Now you can refresh the Duplicator's settings page, the corresponding checkbox will be enabled.


# Installing a CRON job
First of all, you must install PWCron:[http://modules.processwire.com/modules/pwcron/](http://modules.processwire.com/modules/pwcron/)


To edit a crontab through the command line, type: `cronjob -e` then add for example the following line:
> `*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/php /www/mysite/wwwroot/site/modules/PWCron/cron.php >/dev/null 2>&1`


If you are running CRON via a panel, please rely on the documentation of your hosting provider. Do not hesitate to ping on the support forum thread.

#### Some hosting companies donâ€™t allow access to cron
If this the case, you can rely on [LazyCron](https://processwire.com/api/modules/lazy-cron/) module.


#### Example CRON delay table:

| When | Settings |
| -------- | -------- |
| Every 1 minute   | */1 * * * *   |
| Every 15 minutes   | */15 * * * *   |
| Every 30 minutes |	*/30 * * * *
| Every 1 hour |	0 * * * * |
| Every 6 hours |	0 */6 * * * |
| Every 12 hours |	0 */12 * * * |
| Once a day |	4 0 * * * |
| Once a week |	4 0 * * 0 |
| Once a month |	4 0 1 * * |

# Issues

## Timeout
Timeout usually happen if you are on a low-end budget host with limitations. The easiest way to solve this issue, is to use directory filters on some of your larger directories like your `files`, `vendor`, or even `bower_components` directory to get the size down. Then reinstall the package at the new location and then FTP all the files over that you filtered.

**Hosting Provider Issue List:**
* 1and1 Shared hosting (resolved by using Filters)
* Dreamhost hosting (resolved using the `Archive Flush` option); Need to be tested again.
